**networkqit** is a Python package for working within the spectral entropy framework of complex networks.
The spectral entropies framework was firstly introduced in the paper:

 Spectral Entropies as Information-Theoretic Tools for Complex Network Comparison, Phys. Rev. X 6, 041062 (2016)

This toolbox is among the first implementations of the spectral entropy framework.
It entails both computation of the density matrices, as well as number of methods of model fitting methods.
If you are using **networkqit** please cite the following paper:

 Thermodynamics of network model fitting with spectral entropies, Phys. Rev. E 98, 022322 (2018)
